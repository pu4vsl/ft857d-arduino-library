This Arduino library allows the Arduino to control various functions of a Yaesu radio through the use of “Computer Aided Transceiver” (CAT) functions. Although the CAT command byte definitions are aimed at a Yaesu FT-857D, many of the functions should work along the FT-8\*7 platform with little or no need for modification.
